 * Toasts, fed by the backend.

 * Every message the user has to see is published once in Go and drawn by
 * whoever is listening — a webhook for the person who walked away, this for the
 * one who is here. So this file subscribes rather than decides: it does not
 * know why a message exists, only how it looks.
 *
 * A store rather than context because half the callers are not components. A
 * failed RPC in lib/, an error caught in an event handler, a Wails binding that
 * rejected — those had nowhere to put a message and so each grew its own inline
 * `note` state that only the one screen showing it could see.
