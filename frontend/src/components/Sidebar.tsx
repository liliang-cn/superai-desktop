  // and a shut drawer is off the screen entirely, so there is no width to save.

  // under its 640px query, but CSS can only lay out text that was rendered, and

  // ⌘1 / ⌘2 / ⌘3 / ⌘, — the hints in the rows, made real.

  // Three things this deliberately does not do:
  //
  // 1. It does not refuse to fire while a text field has focus. The whole
  //    point is leaving the composer mid-sentence to check Stats, and a
  //    shortcut that stops working exactly where you spend your time is a
  //    shortcut nobody learns. It is safe here because every binding requires
  //    ⌘: with Command held, none of "1" "2" "3" "," puts a character into an
  //    input, so there is no keystroke left to swallow.
  // 2. It does not fire mid-composition. A Chinese IME uses the digit row to
  //    pick candidates, and while WKWebView is reordering composition events
  //    (see lib/ime.ts) a stray modifier read could turn "选第 2 个候选" into
  //    "go to Stats". isComposing plus the legacy 229 keyCode is the same
  //    guard the composer uses.
  // 3. It does not bind outside the desktop window. In a browser tab ⌘1–⌘3
  //    switch the browser's own tabs, and preventDefault on that is taking
  //    something away from the user that was never ours. The body class is the
  //    same switch the hint's CSS keys on — read at keystroke time, because
  //    main.tsx sets it in an effect that runs after this one.
